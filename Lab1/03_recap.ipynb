    "#### 1.  Virtual screening in OOD(out-of-distribution) setting \n",
    "In most scenarios in drug discovery involving novel chemical space, the screening set might be entirely or partially out of the distribution of the dataset used for model training. Therefore, it is crucial to train a QSAR model that can generalize well to unseen chemical spaces. In this context, it's important to design the data splitting strategy to effectively select models that can generalize better to the chemical space of the screening library.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise, you can choose a different commercial screening library that covers distinct chemical spaces or subsample a few clusters of compounds from your training set and select the best splitting approach for model training. You can follow the approach proposed by [Tossou et al. 2024](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01774). The implementation of **MOOD** (Model-Oriented Optimal Data splitting) is available at [splito.MOODSplitter](https://github.com/datamol-io/splito).\n"
