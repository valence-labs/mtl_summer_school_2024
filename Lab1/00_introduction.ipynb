    "### Ligand-based virtual screening\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy focuses on analyzing the structures, physicochemical properties, and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of compounds with both known and unknown activities. By establishing SAR, it predicts and screens the activity of novel compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, a target protein is not directly used to identify potential ligands. Instead, the emphasis is on finding compounds that are structurally and functionally similar to known active compounds. It is an important complementary means for molecular docking, and the strategy has the advantages of fast speed and good versatility (not limited by the target structure).\n",

The choice of which chemical libraries to screen should be guided by the goals of the project and the biological system of interest. It depends on the diversity of the chemical space, the quality and availability of compounds, and any associated bioactivity data.  \n",

    "#### Data splitting \n",
    "\n",
    "The original data in a machine learning model is typically taken and split into two, three or more sets. The three sets commonly used are the training set, validation set and the testing set. \n",

    "Common data splitting techniques in drug discovery:\n",
    "- **Random splitting**: Randomly divides the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
    "- **Scaffold-based splitting**: Splits data based on the molecular scaffolds (core structures) of the compounds.\n",
    "- **Temporal splitting**: Splits data based on the time of data generation, with older data used for training and newer data for testing.\n",
    "- **Activity-based splitting**: Ensures that compounds with a range of activities (e.g., high, medium, low) are present in both training and test sets.\n",
    "- **Cluster-base splitting**:  Uses clustering algorithms to group similar compounds and then splits clusters into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **choice** of splitting approach depends on factors such as: \n",
    "- the stage and purpose of the drug discovery program\n",

    "- Cross-Validation: Partition the dataset into k-folds, train the model on k-1 folds, and validate on the remaining fold. Repeat k times and average the results.\n",
    "- Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV): A special case of k-fold where k equals the number of samples. Train on all samples except one, and test on the excluded sample. Repeat for all samples.\n",

    "In this first lab, we will delve into the realm of virtual screening. Using datasets of 2D molecules, we will develop predictive models to assess inhibitory activity against a human kinase EGFR(Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) protein. Building on concepts from lectures on molecular representation, scoring, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Chemistry, we will utilize `PyTorch`,`PyG`, `Scikit-learn`, and other libraries to create both GNN models and classical Random Forest models with molecular fingerprints. The ultimate objective is to screen a small commercial library and select **100** promising and **diverse** molecules with molecular weight between **280 and 400 Da** for further experimental investigation."
